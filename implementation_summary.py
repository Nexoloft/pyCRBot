Implementation Summary: Continuous Battle Button Search

This document describes the implemented changes to handle the scenario where:
1. The app is reopened
2. User clicks OK to go back to the home screen
3. If battle button isn't found, click the screen every second until the battle button is found

CHANGES MADE:

1. Modified `_handle_battle_end()` in battle_runner.py:
   - After clicking OK button and transitioning to home screen
   - Continuously searches for battle button for up to 30 seconds
   - If battle button not found, clicks center of screen (209, 316) to refresh
   - Waits exactly 1 second between clicks as requested
   - Falls back to default battle button position (209, 600) if timeout reached

2. Modified `start_first_battle()` in emulator_bot.py:
   - When starting the first battle from home page
   - Continuously searches for battle button for up to 30 seconds  
   - If battle button not found, clicks center of screen (209, 316) to refresh
   - Waits exactly 1 second between clicks as requested
   - Logs timeout if battle button never found

KEY FEATURES:
- Continuous clicking every 1 second when battle button not found
- Screen refresh clicks at center position (209, 316) - properly scaled for 419x633 screen
- Proper timeout handling (30 seconds)
- Detailed logging of search progress
- Fallback to known battle button positions
- Graceful handling of shutdown requests

BEHAVIOR FLOW:
1. Detect OK button and click it
2. Wait 3 seconds for transition to home screen
3. Start continuous search loop:
   a. Take screenshot
   b. Search for battle button template
   c. If found: click and return success
   d. If not found: click center screen (209, 316)
   e. Wait 1 second
   f. Repeat until timeout (30 seconds)
4. On timeout: try fallback position (209, 600)

This ensures the bot can handle various UI states and popup conditions
that might prevent the battle button from being immediately visible.
